# Twitter-Frontend-Clone

## What I learnt
- textarea for multi-line input
  - resize property
- Array method of .forEach()
- data attributes
  - Has the use of storing information that can relate elements together.
  - For this application had the advantage of not having to add event listeners to each icon but rather
    to simply add data attributes and set the value of said attribute to the UUID. This allowed
    use to distinguish which tweets icons where clicked.
- Conditionally render styles by combining booleans + adding/removing CSS Classes based on boolean value.
- CDN's to import premade icons
- UUID: Unique Universal Identifiers to identify tweets.
